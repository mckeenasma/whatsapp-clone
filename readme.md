# Exam Questions
> Describe the scope of the cloned app. Include the things/features that you added and discuss also those ideas that have not included because of time constraints.

**The things**:
* Supposedly the app that I wanted to clone from was WhatsApp, and put database on it.
* After a while, I encountered too many bugs, errors and also the author used AWS for database and I was not able to follow since I do not have any Bank Card at the moment.
* I tried making a new clone in order to fill out the needs to make a database on the said app.
* I tried cloning an app that uses firebase, and I successfully do it, but with time and responsibilities in hand, I was not able to implement it to the WhatsApp application.

> Discuss briefly your learning experience

**The experience**:
* It was a long sleepless nights, where all my cravings for games and procrastination combines but I still persist to continue.
* **What made me sleepless?** 
    * **bugs**, **understanding the code** and **alternative solution for the database**.
* At first the author was using the Typescript programming language for making the react-native application, and he then uses AWS database which requires a card bank account in where my limitations occur.
* Instead of using the Typescript, I used the JavaScript programming language. And instead of using AWS as database I used Firebase.
